My Project focused on conducting a twitter sentiment analysis in the field of social media analytics.
The Primary objective is to analysis information in tweets to categorize the Sentiments if they ara ( Positive, Negative or Nutral ) to know if people Happy,Sad or just sharing informations.
I used a powerful tool in the field of NLP (BERT pretrained model) that capture the context and relationships between words in a sentence.
